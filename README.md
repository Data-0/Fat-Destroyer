This mod ads the option for the player to choose when to despawn fat. You can use the settings menu to choose a % amount to start despawning at, going from 10% up to 80%. 

Fat will be despawned everytime you change scene. Any fat over your desired setting will remain. Doesn't prevent low condition fat from going into your inventory when harvesting from a carcass. It will despawn on a scene change though.

Works on inventory fat and fat that's just laying outside.
